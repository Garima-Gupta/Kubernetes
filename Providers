Kubernetes can run on various platforms: from your laptop, to VMs on a cloud provider, to a rack of bare metal servers.

The effort required to set up a cluster varies from running a single command to crafting your own customized cluster.

LOCAL MACHINE SOLUTIONS:
================================
1)Minikube is the recommended method for creating a local, single-node Kubernetes cluster for development and testing. Setup is 
completely automated and doesnâ€™t require a cloud provider account.

2)Kubeadm-dind is a multi-node (while minikube is single-node) Kubernetes cluster which only requires a docker daemon. It uses 
docker-in-docker technique to spawn the Kubernetes cluster.

3)Ubuntu on LXD supports a nine-instance deployment on localhost.

4)IBM Cloud Private-CE (Community Edition) can use VirtualBox on your machine to deploy Kubernetes to one or more VMs for development
and test scenarios. Scales to full multi-node cluster.

5)IBM Cloud Private-CE (Community Edition) on Linux Containers is a Terraform/Packer/BASH based Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts 
to create a seven node (1 Boot, 1 Master, 1 Management, 1 Proxy and 3 Workers) LXD cluster on Linux Host.
